# Shell Scripts

A Group of General PowerShell Scripts to automate some of my daily works that I have to do manually every time.

#

### Available Scripts
Current Available Scripts as I keep automate any repetitive tasks 

To Easy Use them you can use any Reg files provided with the same ps1 files But remember to change the path of the file and this will add the script to your Right-Click Context Menu to easily run it

> **Rename-Subtitles**: Renaming subtitles as the video name was very repeated mission for me, so this script read all files from selected folder and rename subtitles as videos in order
```
To Run it pass this to powershell
    Rename-Subtitle.ps1 {{FolderPath}}
```

> **Change Folder Icon** : I like playing games and love to add game icon to its folder and doing that manually is very boring and repeated for me, so this script read all files and select that one with .ico extension and change folder thumbnail
```
To Run it pass this to powershell
    Change-Folder-Thumbnail.ps1 {{FolderPath}}
```
